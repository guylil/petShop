                Ravens are a common species of large black birds of the genus Corvus. Ravens can be domesticated and kept as pets by both the Muggle and the wizarding community, however, they are much more common in the latter. Ravens can be purchased at the wizarding pet shops, Magical Menagerie and Le Corbeau Mystique.

                A raven is one possible corporeal form of the Patronus Charm.

                <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
                The raven was the family emblem of the Lestrange family.

                In 1993, the Magical Menagerie had a noisy cage of ravens.

                In 1993, some of the members of the Frog Choir held ravens while performing the song "Something Wicked This Way Comes."

                In 1995, Filius Flitwick's fifth year Charms students practised the Silencing Charm on ravens. Ronald Weasley's attempt at the charm had no effect on his "large and ugly raven," but Hermione Granger was successful at Silencing it.

            <p>The Raven is the mascot for Ravenclaw House in the film adaptations. However, this is not canonical because, in the books (a higher source of canon), the Ravenclaw mascot is the Eagle. There is a spell to turn ravens into writing desks. </p>
